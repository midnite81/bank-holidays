This package integrates with the UK Government's Bank Holiday Json response. It has been principally been
designed for use with laravel, but is framework agnostic under the hood. **This package requires PHP 7.1 or greater.**

## Installation

```
composer require midnite81/bank-holidays
```

If you are using laravel 5.4 or less, you will need to register the Bank Holiday service provider. If you are using 5.5

```
 'providers' => [
      ...
      \Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHolidayServiceProvider::class,
      ...
  ];
```

You will need to publish the configuration file. To do this, please run

```
php artisan vendor:publish provider="Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHolidayServiceProvider"
```

## Limitation

The UK Government provides the bank holiday json feed, this at the time of writing only includes the 
years between 2015 and 2021.

## Http standards

To adhere to better standards, this package uses the popular and powerful PHP-HTTP library to make HTTP requests. 
This allows you, should you wish, to use your own HTTP Client instead of the default provided with this package. 
For more information on PHP-HTTP, please visit [php-http.org](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/).

## Laravel usage example

**Checking a date to see if it's a bank holiday**

```php

use Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\IBankHoliday;

public function myFunction(IBankHoliday $bankHoliday)
{ 
    $bankHolidayEntity = $bankHoliday->bankHolidayDetail(
        \Carbon\Carbon::create(2020, 01, 01), 
        \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES
    );

    // if the date provided is a bank holiday a BankHolidayEntity is returned
    // otherwise it returns null. If the entity is returned you can access the entity properties below.

```
[See entity properties](#bank-holiday-entity)

```php
   
    if ($bankHoliday->isBankHoliday(
        \Carbon\Carbon::create(2020, 01, 01),
        \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES
        )) {
        // if it is a bank holiday do this ...
    }
}
```

**Get all bank holiday dates**

```php

use Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\IBankHoliday;

public function myFunction(IBankHoliday $bankHoliday)
{ 
    $bankHolidays = $bankHoliday->getAll(\Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES);

    foreach($bankHolidays as $bankHoliday) { 
        echo $bankHoliday->title . "<br>\n";  
    }
}
```

**Check data range**

The UK government supplies the data which is used in this package and is subject to date range limitations.
Due to these limitations, this package provides two methods for you to ascertain the minimum and maximum 
dates in the data are available for you to check against.

```php

use Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\IBankHoliday;

public function myFunction(IBankHoliday $bankHoliday)
{ 
    $minimumDate = $bankHoliday->getMinDate(\Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES);
    $maximumDate = $bankHoliday->getMaxDate(\Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES);
}
```

## Usage without laravel

```php

public function someFunction()
{ 
    $config = [
       'cache-duration' => 60 * 60 * 24,
       'bank-holiday-url' => 'https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json',
       'cache-key' => 'midnite81-bank-holidays',
       'cache-class' => YourCacheClass::class, // you will need to create a cache class
       'filesystem-class' => \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Drivers\PhpFileSystem::class,
       'http-client' => null,
       'failure-backup' => true,
       'request-factory' => null
    ];

    $cache = new YourCacheClass(); // this must implement \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\Drivers\ICache
    $client = new \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Services\Client(null, null, $config);
    $bankHoliday = new \Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHoliday($client, $cache, $config);

    // Once you have $bankHoliday instantiated you can use the following methods

    $bankHoliday->getAll(int $territory);
    $bankHoliday->bankHolidayDetail(Carbon $date, int $territory);

    // for territory please use the constants in `Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory`
}

```
