designed for use with laravel, but is framework agnostic under the hood. **This package requires PHP 7.1 or greater.**

```

      ...
      \Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHolidayServiceProvider::class,

  ];
```

You will need to publish the configuration file. To do this, please run

```
php artisan vendor:publish provider="Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHolidayServiceProvider"
```

## Http standards

To adhere to better standards, this package uses the popular and powerful PHP-HTTP library to make HTTP requests. 
This allows you, should you wish, to use your own HTTP Client instead of the default provided with this package. 
For more information on PHP-HTTP, please visit [php-http.org](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/).

## Laravel usage example

**Checking a date to see if it's a bank holiday**

```php

use Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\IBankHoliday;

public function myFunction(IBankHoliday $bankHoliday)
{ 
    $bankHoliday = $bankHoliday->bankHolidayDetail(
        \Carbon\Carbon::create(2020, 01, 01), 
        \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES
    );

    // if the date provided is a bank holiday a BankHolidayEntity is returned
    // otherwise it returns null.
   
    if ($bankHoliday == null) {
        // the date provided is not a bank holiday
    }
    
    if ($bankHoliday != null) { 
        echo $bankHoliday->title; // returns "New Year's Day"
        echo $bankHoliday->date; // returns Carbon date object    
    } 
}
```

**Get all bank holiday dates**

```php

use Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\IBankHoliday;

public function myFunction(IBankHoliday $bankHoliday)
{ 
    $bankHolidays = $bankHoliday->getAll(\Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory::ENGLAND_AND_WALES);

    foreach($bankHolidays as $bankHoliday) { 
        echo $bankHoliday->title . "<br>\n";  
    }
}
```

```php

public function someFunction()
{ 
    $config = [
       'cache-duration' => 60 * 60 * 24,
       'bank-holiday-url' => 'https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json',
       'cache-key' => 'midnite81-bank-holidays',
       'cache-class' => YourCacheClass::class, // you will need to create a cache class 
       'http-client' => null,
       'request-factory' => null
    ];

    $cache = new YourCacheClass(); // this must implement \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Contracts\Drivers\ICache
    $client = new \Midnite81\BankHolidays\Services\Client(null, null, $config);
    $bankHoliday = new \Midnite81\BankHolidays\BankHoliday($client, $cache, $config);

    // Once you have $bankHoliday instantiated you can use the following methods

    $bankHoliday->getAll(int $territory);
    $bankHoliday->bankHolidayDetail(Carbon $date, int $territory);

    // for territory please use the constants in `Midnite81\BankHolidays\Enums\Territory`
}

```
